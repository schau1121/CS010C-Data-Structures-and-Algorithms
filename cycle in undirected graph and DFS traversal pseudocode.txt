Pseudocode for an algorithm to check if an undirected graph has a cycle
use depth first search to detect cycle in O(n + m) time.
	DFS traversal on graph
	For every visited node 'n'
		if there is an adjacent node 't' such that t is already visited and is not the parent of n
			return true
	return false


Pseudocode for DFS using a stack
	for each node
		visited = false
	stack = empty
	push initial node to stack
	while stack is not empty
		curr = top of stack
		if curr is not visited
			curr->visited = true
		for all edges of curr
			push neighbor to stack
